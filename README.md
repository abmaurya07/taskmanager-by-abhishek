## Features
- **Authentication Middleware**: Ensures users are authenticated before accessing the dashboard, redirecting unauthenticated users to the login page.
- **User Authentication**: Includes login and signup functionality with validations.
- **Task Dashboard**: Displays a summary of tasks, including total, in-progress, and completed tasks.
- **Task Management**: Allows users to create, view, edit, delete, and filter tasks.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, displaying tasks in table format on desktop and card format on mobile.
- **Bulk Delete**: Supports bulk deletion of tasks with a confirmation popup.
- **Security**: Utilizes bcrypt for password encryption and environment variables for sensitive data.

## Pages üìÑ

1. **Login**: User authentication page.
2. **Signup**: User registration page with username and password validations.
3. **Dashboard**: Main task management interface, accessible only to authenticated users.


## Signup Form Validation üìù

- **Username**: Must be at least 6 characters long. If the username already exists, a 409 status code is returned, prompting the user to choose another username.
- **Password**: Must meet the following criteria:
  - At least 8 characters long
  - Contains at least one uppercase letter
  - Contains at least one lowercase letter
  - Contains at least one digit
  - Contains at least one special character

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

1. **Authentication**: The app includes middleware to check user authentication status. Unauthenticated users are redirected to the login page.
2. **Task Management**: Users can create, view, edit, delete, and filter tasks. Tasks can be displayed in a table or card format depending on the device.
3. **Bulk Operations**: Users can perform bulk deletions with a confirmation popup to prevent accidental deletions.
4. **Responsive Design**: The application adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
    ```

5. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Usage
### Signup

## Configuration
Sensitive data and configuration values are stored in environment variables. For the Next.js application, create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your configuration values.

Example `.env.local` file:
```plaintext
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```
